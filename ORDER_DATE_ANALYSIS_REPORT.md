## 📊 **KEY FINDINGS**

### **The Paradox:**
- **Shopee started earlier** (Sep 19, 2020) vs **Lazada** (Oct 5, 2022)
- **Shopee has longer total timespan** (1,867 days) vs **Lazada** (1,122 days)
- **BUT Lazada has MORE unique order dates** (1,068) vs **Shopee** (843)

---

## 🎯 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **1. Order Distribution Strategy**
- **Lazada:** Spreads orders across more days with lower daily volume
  - **Average:** 8.5 orders per day
  - **Date Coverage:** 95.1% (very consistent daily ordering)
  - **Pattern:** Steady, consistent daily business
  
- **Shopee:** Concentrates orders into fewer high-volume days
  - **Average:** 29.5 orders per day  
  - **Date Coverage:** 45.1% (operates intermittently)
  - **Pattern:** Burst/batch ordering behavior

### **2. Business Operating Models**

**Lazada - Continuous Operations:**
- Orders nearly every day (95.1% date coverage)
- Only 55 missing days in 1,123-day span
- Consistent 7-day-a-week operations
- Lower but steady daily volumes

**Shopee - Periodic/Batch Operations:**
- Orders on only 45.1% of available days
- 1,025 missing days in 1,868-day span
- Concentrated high-volume periods
- Higher daily volumes when active

### **3. Detailed Year-by-Year Comparison**

| Year | Lazada Orders | Lazada Unique Days | Shopee Orders | Shopee Unique Days |
|------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 2020 | 0 | 0 | 41 | 32 |
| 2021 | 0 | 0 | 2,483 | 168 |
| 2022 | 144 | 50 | 7,816 | 197 |
| 2023 | 2,998 | 350 | 4,671 | 163 |
| 2024 | 3,519 | 364 | 263 | 16 |
| 2025 | 2,377 | 304 | 9,616 | 267 |

**Key Observation:** Even when Shopee has more orders (2022: 7,816 vs 144), Lazada still achieves similar unique dates (197 vs 50).

### **For Operations:**
1. **Lazada** needs consistent daily fulfillment capacity

## ✅ **CONCLUSION**

**The reason Lazada has more unique order dates than Shopee is NOT a data quality issue, but reflects fundamentally different business operating models:**

- **Lazada:** Consistent daily operations (95% date coverage)
- **Shopee:** Concentrated burst operations (45% date coverage)

This explains why despite Shopee having:
- Earlier start date (2+ years before Lazada)
- Longer total timespan (1,867 vs 1,122 days)  
- More total orders (24,890 vs 9,038)

**Lazada still achieves more unique order dates through consistent daily operations.**
