COMPLETED TASKS
================================================================================

✅ TASK #1: Implement Scent/Volume Columns for Product Variants
   Status: COMPLETED
   Date: November 4, 2025
   
   What was done:
   - Replaced generic variant_attribute_1/2/3 columns with domain-specific 
     'scent' and 'volume' columns
   - Implemented smart parser with regex pattern to detect ml/mL/L units
   - Logic: If variant name contains ml pattern → volume field, else → scent
   - Created base variants for ALL 71 products (even those without variant data)
   
   Results:
   - Shopee variants increased from 15 to 58 (43 base variants added)
   - Total variants: 162 (104 Lazada + 58 Shopee)
   - All products now have at least 1 variant for proper joins
   
   Files Modified:
   - app/config.py (DIM_PRODUCT_VARIANT_COLUMNS schema)
   - app/Transformation/harmonize_dim_product.py (parse_variant_attributes function)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ TASK #2: Transfer Prices from Products to Variants + Add Versioning
   Status: COMPLETED
   Date: November 4, 2025
   
   What was done:
   - Removed 'current_selling_price' from dim_product table
   - Added 4 new fields to dim_product_variant:
     * current_price (variant-level pricing)
     * original_price (before discounts)
     * created_at (timestamp)
     * last_updated (timestamp)
   - Updated extraction functions to populate prices at variant level
   - Implemented special pricing calculation for Lazada (time-based discounts)
   
   Results:
   - Price granularity: Product-level → Variant-level
   - Initial coverage: 119/162 variants with prices (73.5%)
   - All 162 variants have timestamps
   - Price range: ₱5 - ₱1,280
   
   Files Modified:
   - app/config.py (removed price from products, added to variants)
   - app/Transformation/harmonize_dim_product.py (extraction functions)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ TASK #3: Impute Missing Prices for Base Variants
   Status: COMPLETED
   Date: November 4, 2025
   
   What was done:
   - Identified 43 base variants without prices (26.5% of total)
   - Implemented Option 1: Use product-level price_info for base variants
   - Modified extract_shopee_product_variants() to accept product_price_info
   - Function now uses product-level price when variant-level unavailable
   
   Results:
   - Price coverage improved from 73.5% to 95.1%
   - 35 base variants gained prices (81.4% of base variants)
   - 8 remaining products need Shopee variant API data (TODO #9)
   - Average price: ₱497.97
   
   Files Modified:
   - app/Transformation/harmonize_dim_product.py (extract_shopee_product_variants)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ TASK #9: Resolve Shopee Variants API Issue
   Status: COMPLETED
   Date: November 4, 2025
   
   What was done:
   - Fixed shopee_api_calls.py to use individual item_id calls (not batch)
   - Created fetch_missing_variants.py script for targeted variant fetching
   - Fixed harmonization to handle new API response structure (model vs model_list)
   - Fixed price_info extraction (list instead of dict)
   - Fetched variant data for 13 products with has_model=True
   
   Results:
   - API successfully fetched 151 variant models
   - Shopee variants increased from 48 to 186 (151 real + 35 base)
   - Total variants increased from 162 to 290
   - Price coverage: 100% (all 290 variants have prices)
   - Average price: ₱527.64
   
   Files Modified:
   - app/Extraction/shopee_api_calls.py (extract_product_variants function)
   - app/Transformation/harmonize_dim_product.py (variant extraction logic)
   
   Files Created:
   - fetch_missing_variants.py (utility script)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ TASK #4: Replace Missing SKUs with "not_found"
   Status: COMPLETED
   Date: November 4, 2025
   
   What was done:
   - Implemented fallback logic for canonical_sku extraction
   - Lazada: SellerSku → SkuId → "not_found"
   - Shopee: model_sku → model_id → "not_found"
   - Base variants: item_sku → item_id → "not_found"
   - Added validation to strip whitespace and handle empty strings
   
   Results:
   - SKU coverage improved from 67.6% to 100%
   - All 290 variants now have valid canonical_sku values
   - Previously 94 variants had NaN, now all populated
   - 0 variants marked as "not_found" (all had valid IDs)
   
   Files Modified:
   - app/Transformation/harmonize_dim_product.py (all variant extraction functions)

TECHNICAL NOTES
================================================================================

Schema Changes:
- DIM_PRODUCT: 8 columns → 7 columns (removed price)
- DIM_PRODUCT_VARIANT: 7 columns → 11 columns (added scent, volume, prices, timestamps)

Key Functions Modified:
- parse_variant_attributes(): Returns (scent, volume) with ml detection
- extract_lazada_product_variants(): Adds prices + timestamps + base variants
- extract_shopee_product_variants(): Adds prices + timestamps + base variants

Patterns Used:
- Volume Detection: r'\d+\s*(ml|ML|mL|Ml|l|L)\b'
- Platform Keys: 1=Lazada, 2=Shopee
- ID Strategy: Float decimals (x.1 for Lazada, x.2 for Shopee)

Understanding SKU Fields:
================================================================================

PLATFORM_SKU_ID (Platform's Internal ID)
- Purpose: Platform's system-generated unique identifier for each variant
- Source: 
  * Lazada: SkuId (e.g., 30683243468)
  * Shopee: model_id (e.g., 257229121669)
- Characteristics:
  * Always exists (never null)
  * Always unique per variant
  * Not human-readable
  * No business meaning
  * Used for platform-specific operations and API calls

CANONICAL_SKU (Unified Business Join Key)
- Purpose: Standardized SKU for data warehouse joins and business operations
- Source with Fallback Logic:
  * Lazada: SellerSku (your custom SKU) → SkuId (if no custom SKU)
  * Shopee: model_sku (your custom SKU) → model_id (if no custom SKU)
  * Base variants: item_sku → item_id → "not_found" (never reached)
- Characteristics:
  * Always populated (100% coverage)
  * Preferred: Your business SKU when available (human-readable like "LAV", "w180")
  * Fallback: Platform ID when no custom SKU exists
  * Used as primary join key across all fact tables
  * Standardized field name regardless of platform

Current Distribution:
- 142 variants (49.0%): Have custom business SKUs (canonical_sku ≠ platform_sku_id)
- 148 variants (51.0%): Use platform ID as canonical_sku (canonical_sku = platform_sku_id)
- 0 variants: Needed "not_found" fallback

Why Both Fields Matter:
- platform_sku_id: Traceability to platform's system, debugging, reconciliation
- canonical_sku: Business operations, data warehouse joins, analytics
- Together they provide both platform-specific tracking AND unified business logic
