## 🚨 **KEY FINANCIAL DISCREPANCY IDENTIFIED**

### **The Mystery of the Missing ₱10.8M:**

Your initial confusion was **100% justified**! Here's what's actually happening:

| Metric                                        | Amount          | Source          |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| **Gross Revenue (price_total)**               | ₱ 26,688,579.14 | dim_order.csv   |
| **Gross Revenue (original_unit_price × qty)** | ₱ 22,981,855.56 | fact_orders.csv |
| **Total Discounts**                           | ₱ 1,133,600.70  | fact_orders.csv |
| **Net Sales (paid_price)**                    | ₱ 14,718,956.86 | fact_orders.csv |
| **Shipping Fees**                             | ₱ 1,502,937.25  | fact_orders.csv |

### **🧮 The Math That Doesn't Add Up:**

- **Expected:** ₱26,688,579 - ₱1,133,601 = ₱25,554,978
- **Actual:** ₱14,718,957
- **Missing:** ₱**10,836,021** (40.6% of gross revenue!)

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **1. Data Source Inconsistency:**

- `price_total` (dim_order) vs `original_unit_price × quantity` (fact_orders) differs by ₱3,706,724
- This suggests **different pricing calculation methods** between the two tables

### **2. Platform Fee Deductions (Most Likely Culprit):**

The ₱10.8M gap likely includes:

- **Lazada/Shopee commission fees** (typically 2-5% of gross)
- **Payment processing fees** (credit card, e-wallet fees)
- **Platform advertising costs** (sponsored product fees)
- **Transaction fees** and **penalties**

### **3. Missing Fields in Your Schema:**

Your current data model doesn't capture:

- Platform commission amounts
- Payment gateway fees
- Marketing/advertising deductions
- Tax withholdings
